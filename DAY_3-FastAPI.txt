DAY-3-Module1 of project

We have to upload a csv file to FastAPI.

Step 1: We create a post in FastAPI. We read the uploaded file using File module which is an built-in module.

Step 2: We pass the file to ConvertBytesintoString function which converts the bytes into String. Then we convert it into Json format as it is the final format we need.
